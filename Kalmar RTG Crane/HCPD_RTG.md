# Handling container loading/unloading using the RTG crane

## Project aim

Use human centered product development process to improve existing container handling process with the RTG crane.

## Project scope

This work is performed as part of a course project in collaboration with Kalmar to improve their container handling process.

The existing container handling by RTG cranes with human operators has several challenges, e.g., human intensive work, and high chances of error. These challeges can be reduced with recent technological advancement and by performing the operations remotely. For example, cameras, sound, AR/VR headset, guiding laser can be used to aid the human operator to remotely handle container loading or unloading operation. However, there is a lack of human centric study on the use of these tools. As part of this work, we conducted study on several of these tools that can help RTG crane operators to remotely load/unload containers.
