This directory contains several other UX projects, I have completed during my Master's stuides. They are listed in the following.

## ToGether
ToGather is a mobile application for  event backing, tracking, and feedback. It allows users to record ideas for local social gatherings.
By using this, the organizers can gauge interest and improve their ideas before selecting the idea. 

In this work, I, first, developed, a conceptual model of the application. Second, I developed a navigation model with pen and paper,
made a wireframe for each navigation screen, and developed a mood board to select colors. Finally, I developed a mobile application
prototype in Adobe XD resembling the conceptual model. 

## BioHacking

## Kalmar RTG Crane

## Snap Hub

## Social Robotics

## Social Togetherness
In this work, I propose social gardening as a mechanism to build a community through which young and old can get connected and share
knowledge among them. I use an Experience-driven design (EDD) methodology: 1) to identify the expected experience goals,
2) later on to evaluate those goals with a developed mobile application by conducting a user study.
