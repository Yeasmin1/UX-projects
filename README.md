## ToGether
ToGather is a mobile application that is an event backing, tracking, and feedback system. It allows users to create ideas and opportunities for local social gatherings. By this, the organizers can gauge interest and improve their ideas before picking them. In this work, we, first, develop a conceptual model of the application. Second, we developed a navigation model in pen and paper, made a wireframe for each navigation screen, and developed a mood board to select colors. Finally, we developed a mobile application prototype in Adobe XD resembling the conceptual model.

## Social Togetherness
In this work, we propose social gardening as a tool to build a community through which young and old can get connected and share knowledge among them. We use an Experience-driven design (EDD) methodology, first, to identify the expected experience goals and later on to evaluate the developed mobile application by performing a user study.
